genericishBashScripts
=====================
Scripts what I make when Im doing stuff... 

xrandr scripts for various different monitors,
SSH scripts (no passwords)
Some useful application starters (e.g. multiSkype)
Web browsers started in specific profiles
etc...


There are some experimental script tools here that do things like 
create contexts at points in the file system. 
Its an interesting work, and I think the principals therein are useful
